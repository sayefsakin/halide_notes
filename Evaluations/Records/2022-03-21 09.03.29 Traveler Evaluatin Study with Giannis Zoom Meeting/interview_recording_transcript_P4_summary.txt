Merged codes
-------------------------------
threats: doesn't seem to understand the given trial, wrong wording of trial
expects: the brush spans over the whole view, cannot differential it, cannot distinguish between consecutive smaller bars, click on bar in histogram view, highlighting update in the tree by selecing from gantt or utilization

Trial:
E1: done
E2: successful with hint
E3: unsuccessful
E4: succsesful with hint
E5:  `the rate actually like increases and I dont know if its relevant but its more noisy, its not noisy its actually more misses and less misses, more changes in the misses, when the cpu utilization is high`

interivew:
I1: gantt (most), dependncy tree
I2: interlinking between the views
I3: its awesome, have everything
I4: cpu rate inside gantt bars with color coding
I5: how to download and use it

Summary
------------------------------
This participant looked very comfortable with the dataset. Though with the tasks he struggle, it mostly attributed to the misunderstanding of the given trials. With enough explanantion and hint, the participant was able to perform all the trials except E3.
