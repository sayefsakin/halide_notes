share your experience?
pros: free, easier, nice when no bugs, giving the info what was needed
validity threats: dont remember details
purpose: visualize traces

which view specifically helped you mostly?
views: gantt, utilization
purpose: find execution on core, how execution distributed, varify execution location, find busy cores
other tool: vampyr
process: annotate execution, annotate function
prefered feature: annotate

which of the featurs you liked most?
views: gantt

any experiences with other performance analysis tools?
other tool: VTune
purpose: find funciton taking the longest time
validity threats: dont remember details

how would you compare Traveler with other performance analysis tools?
pros: nice, data was fine
cons: unsure how to navigate multiple datasets, not user friendly, didn't work expectedly, not intuitive, version compatibiltiy
suggestion: make it more intuitive

Vampyr and Traveler, how did you feel about those compared to each other?
pros: working fine, same level of satisfaction compared to vampyr

how did you get to where you wanted to be?
process: scrolling, smaller data didnt scroll
pros: zoom in-out works fine

do you have a good sense of what else you were trying to do when you were looking at the gantt chart?
purpose: how execution distributed, find execution dependency,  if evenly distributed among cores, find dependent execution location

did you used "click-show yellow lines"?
process: use the dependencies to extract more information

which version of Traveler you used?
version: main version, time unknown

have you ever used task dependency tree?
views: didn't use dependency tree but suggested it
validity threats: not proper dataset, didnt know about feature

didnt use interval histogram
didnt use functional boxplot
didnt use line chart view
validity threats: feature was not implemented
pros: functional box plot looks nice
pros: functional box plot and line chart view looks nice

did it actually help you in finding out any specific bug in your code?
process: make sense

any kind of suggestion, or proposal for was so that we could add any additional feature in here Traveler?
pros: offers a lot
final comment: its really good. its very helpful, I am sure maybe poeple would actually appreciate what you did

Summary
Although the participant couldn't remember somethings, they did highlight some important things about how they did the anlaysis as
- annotate execution and function
- using scrolling mostly to navigate but for smaller data didn't just looked into the overview and not scrolling
- use the dependencies to extract more information

They highlighted why they did the anlaysis as,
- to visualize traces and making sense of it
- find execution on core
- how execution distributed and if evenly distributed among cores
- verify execution location
- find busy cores
- find funciton taking the longest time
- find execution dependency
- find dependent execution location

The participant had predisposed expection from their prior experience with another tool,
- have ability to annotate
- a way to navigate between dataset easily
- had predisposed idea of select-deselect behavior

Evaluating Traveler from this participant's expereince has validity problems like,
- the participanat couldn't remember some details
- The participant acknowledge not using larger dataset or with more dependencies
- the participant didnt know about some features which was already there
- Some feature was not implemented at the time of deployment to this participanat
