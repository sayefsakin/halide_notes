Summary
-------------------------------------
This participants had no prior experience in using performance analysis tool. Although showing the demo in dark mode, and giving the trials in light mode discourange the participant and hampered her performance on the trials. Trial E3 was not given due to time limitation. Also, for other trials, the particpant didnt understant the trial at first. With successive explanation her performance improved a little bit.
