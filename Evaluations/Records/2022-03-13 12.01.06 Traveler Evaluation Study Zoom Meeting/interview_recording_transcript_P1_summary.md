Summary
-------------------------------
P1 has no prior experience in using any performance analysis tool before. The introduction briefing was not helpful for the participant. Only enquired 4 evaluation tasks (didn't give E5).
P1 struggled to do all of the tasks. Interviewer and observer helped her mostly to perform the tasks. After providing an elaborate guidance, P1 was able to perform all of the tasks.
during the interview P1 repeatedly mentioned that she have no experience and she needed to explore this tools more. She had no experience working with HPX team but she worked with the Runtime Team leader for around 1 year.
