Bugs
- some error in the console for "Error: <rect> attribute width: A negative value is not valid. ("-225.74117881076995")"
- Functional box plot > Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed'), it comes from updateCursor
- while drugging the brush in the utilization view, sometimes the functional box plot view failed to load. (maybe becuase of the bug mentioned in the previous points)
